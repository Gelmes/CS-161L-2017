REMARKS
- The makefile was made pritty straight forward so it should be able to execute with just make
- to execute using trace file simply enter "cat trace | ./cache.out"
- LRU and FIFO had very similar results for their cache outputs.
- LRU did manage to shine when it came to increased associativity
- For both algorithems increased cache size was a benefit.
