REMARKS
- There is a lot to pick up in this first lab since we are working with a new language. The lab was prity streight forward most of the time was spent in understanding and implementation.
- This code could be further improved by changing the organasation and layout. This is not optimal due to lack of experience with VHDL

==========================================================

BUGS IF ANY 
- The ALU worked fine with the provided test bench. It might need some edge cases but it took some time to try and figure those out.
